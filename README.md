## Migrate the course selling app to next.js

Until now we've built a basic course selling application
 - It uses React for the frontend
 - It uses MongoDB as the database
 - It uses Node.js as the Backend server
 - It is written in JS

The assignment of this week is to move the application over to NextJS

You can bootstrap a nextjs application by calling -
```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

If you have followed the video from Week 10.2, please select these configs to use the Page router (vs the new NextJS 13 app router)

The goal is to - 
 - Move the frontend over to NextJS
 - Move the backend over to NextJS API
 - Convert the complete project to Typescript (and not use JS)
